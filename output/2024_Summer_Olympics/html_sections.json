Subsequent bids for the2008and2012Games were also unsuccessful, as they were awarded toBeijingandLondon, respectively. Undeterred, Paris decided to bid once more for the 2024 edition, which would mark the centenary of its last Games.",
      "The six candidate cities wereParis,Hamburg,Boston,Budapest,Rome, andLos Angeles. The bidding process was slowed by withdrawals, political uncertainty, and rising costs. Boston surpassed Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Washington, DC, for the official U.S. bid. On 27 July 2015, Boston and theUSOCmutually agreed to terminate Boston's bid to host the Games, partly because of mixed feelings among city residents. Hamburg withdrew its bid on 29 November 2015 after holding areferendum.[16]Rome withdrew on 21 September 2016, citing fiscal difficulties.[17]Budapest withdrew on 22 February 2017, after a petition against the bid collected more signatures than necessary for a referendum.[18][19][20]",
